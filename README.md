# Weather_prediction-model

The weather predicting model in this repository uses linear regression, a popular statistical technique, to forecast weather conditions. By analyzing historical weather data, the model establishes relationships between different variables, such as temperature(avg temp, min and max temp) and precipitation to predict future weather patterns.

## Dataset

To train and test the model, a comprehensive weather dataset is required. You can either use your own dataset or explore publicly available weather datasets. Ensure that the dataset includes a variety of weather-related features, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and precipitation.

## Results

The model's performance and accuracy can be evaluated by comparing the predicted weather conditions with actual recorded data. Additionally, you can visualize the predictions using various graphs and charts to gain further insights into the model's performance.

## Contributing

Contributions to this weather predicting model are welcome. If you discover any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
